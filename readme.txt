Ok so for the addfile function, everything is working great I just haven't figured out how to add the file to the 
created minigit directory after compiling. However everything else is working great. The remove file function is also
working as it should.

Update:
I realized that for the addFile function we don't commit them to the minigit - that is the actual commit function oops.
So the addfile function and removeFile functions are done.
